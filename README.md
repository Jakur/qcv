`qcv` is a tool to generate HTML resume from JSON template.

## Use cases
#### Keeping a JSON resume in Git
The tool allows to have one JSON file where the resume information placed. It can be stored in a `git` repository to make the updating process more seamless. There could be branching applied for different versions; the diffs are more simpler to track.
No more `CV_1.pdf`, `CV_1_updated.pdf`, `CV_1_updated_for_facebook.pdf`.

#### Controlling and keeping track of the information
No need to move between different services that generate a resume or/and store it.

#### Generating a simple portfolio website
The tool generates a HTML file based on a HTML template that can be customizable(cooming soon).

## How does it work
The tool replaces variables in a HTML template (see `src/assets/themes`) with corresponding values in the JSON template. Example:
This is a HTML template
```html
<div>{{basics.name}}<div>
```
The JSON template is
```json
{
    "basics": {
        "name": "John Doe"
    }
}
```
So the result will be as follows:
```html
<div>John Doe</div>
```
#### Formatting rules
This is the JSON template example below. It will be generated by the `init` command. It creates `cv.json` file with the similar content:
```json
{
    "basics": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "label": "Programmer",
      "email": "john@gmail.com",
      "phone": "(912) 555-4321",
      "website": "http://johndoe.com",
      "summary": "A brief summary on who I am",
      "location": {
        "country": "The Johnited States Of Doe",
        "address": "2712 Broadway St",
        "city": "San Francisco"
      },
      "profiles": [{
        "network": "Twitter",
        "username": "john",
        "url": "http://twitter.com/john"
      }]
    },
    "work": [{
      "company": "Company",
      "position": "President",
      "website": "http://company.com",
      "start_date": "2013-01-01",
      "end_date": "2014-01-01",
      "summary": "Description..."
    }],
    "projects": [{
      "name": "An app to track time",
      "description": "A web and mobile application that allowed 2500 people to track their working time"
    }],
    "education": [{
      "institution": "University",
      "area": "Software Development",
      "study_type": "Bachelor",
      "start_date": "2011-01-01",
      "end_date": "2013-01-01",
      "courses": [
        "DB1101 - Basic SQL"
      ],
      "location": "Washington DC, US"
    }],
    "skills": [{ "name": "Web Development" }],
    "languages": [{
      "language": "English",
      "level": "Native speaker"
    }]
  }
```
Put your information into this file. Then use the `build simple` command to generate the `cv.html` output.
